LATER: 
- handle multiple tabs so that not multiple connect messages for same user (list of joined users on server? redis?)
- switch to redis to store the online users counter
- think about the guarantee of message order with mongo and if better solution needed frontend
- expand user details to include DOB and fullname
- add user restrictions based on age?
- integrate hatespeach api
- add dynamic username validation checker for registration
- integrate a chat gtp analysis of the chat, with different perception predispositions eg. 'interperet as hostile, interperet as loving'
  - could be an art-piece about how our predispositions affects our interpretation of events
  - eg 'interperet this as if ive been brought up by emotionally volatile parents' 
- a game where a certain number of people enter a chat, alongside a chat gtp bot. People are against the bot and have to vote on who the bot is
